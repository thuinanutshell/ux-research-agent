# Problem Statement
As someone who has conducted many user interviews for non-profit organizations and startups, I've noticed a pain point among user researchers: they lack an all-in-one and streamlined application to help them with reaching out to potential users, scheduling interviews and synthesizing interview notes into patterns. People use Notion, Google Docs, Calendly, Google Sheets, etc. to keep track of this process but oftentimes they are all over the place and hard to manage. Particularly, small organizations and startups do not have a large budget to spend on specialized tools. 

As a result, Han and I are developing a web application to help solve this problem. Our goal is to automate the process of outreach and interview scheduling and leveraging AI with the synthesis step. We believe that the ultimate priority of a user researcher is to generate actionable insights to help a business or organization serve the right needs for the right users rather than spending too much time on cumbersome logistics.
